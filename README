Known Issues:

When printing out block comments in the program listing, the line number 
prepended to the comment will only show the last line number of the comment; 
i.e. it will not print out a line number for each line in the comment.

Newlines within a string that are not escaped will screw up the line number 
count.

If the first line of the program is not a block comment, the compiler will
print out the first line twice

writeln does not take an infinite number of arguments

Calling operators on the values of builtins will sometimes cause undefined behaviour

Calling operators on constant vars will also cause undefined behaviour
